# Plan to Address Backend Server Issues

## 1. Check MongoDB Connection
- Ensure that MongoDB is running on the specified port (`27017`) and that the database `hospitalDB` exists.
- If there are connection errors, log them to understand the issue.

## 2. Enhance Error Handling
- Update the `/patients` POST route to include error handling when saving a patient. This will help identify if there are validation errors or other issues during the save operation.
- Return appropriate error messages to the client if the save operation fails.

## 3. Validate Incoming Data
- Ensure that the client sends the correct data format when making a POST request to `/patients`. This includes all required fields as defined in the `patientSchema`.

## 4. Testing
- After making the changes, test the server to ensure it starts correctly and that data can be added through the `/patients` endpoint.

## Follow-up Steps
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
