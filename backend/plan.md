# Comprehensive Plan for Connecting to MongoDB and Adding Data

## Plan:
1. **MongoDB Connection**:
   - Ensure that the MongoDB connection is established in `backend/server.js` using the provided URI: `mongodb://localhost:27017/hospital_db`.
   - Confirm that the connection logic is correctly implemented and remove any duplicate connection attempts.

2. **Patient Schema**:
   - The patient schema in `backend/models/Patient.js` is already defined correctly. No changes are needed here.

3. **Routes for Patient Data**:
   - The routes in `backend/routes/patients.js` are set up to handle GET and POST requests for patient data. Ensure that these routes are functioning correctly to add and retrieve patient data.

4. **Testing the Connection**:
   - After implementing the above changes, test the connection to MongoDB and verify that data can be added and retrieved successfully using tools like MongoDB Compass.

5. **Environment Variables**:
   - If necessary, update the `.env` file to include the MongoDB URI for better configuration management.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Test the application to ensure that it can connect to MongoDB and handle patient data correctly.
