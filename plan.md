### Plan:
1. **Review Frontend Code**:
   - Confirm that the `Patients.js` file correctly handles the address field in the `newPatient` state and the form submission.
   - Ensure that the address field is included in the form and is being sent to the backend when a new patient is added.

2. **Check Backend API**:
   - Verify that the backend API endpoint (`/api/patients`) is set up to accept the address field in the request body.
   - Ensure that the patient model in the backend (likely in `backend/models/patient.js`) includes the address field in its schema.

3. **Test Functionality**:
   - After confirming the frontend and backend are correctly set up, test the functionality by adding a new patient with an address to ensure it is saved and displayed correctly in the data table.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement any necessary error handling in both the frontend and backend to provide feedback if the address field is not processed correctly.

5. **User Confirmation**:
   - After making any necessary changes, confirm with the user that the address field is functioning as expected.
